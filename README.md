# NasaPictures Project

## Setup

* `npm install`, or `yarn install` - whatever you're into
* Create two postgres databases: `boilermaker` and `boilermaker-test`
* By default, running `npm test` will use `boilermaker-test`, while regular development uses `boilermaker`

## Start

`npm run start-dev` will make great things happen!

If you want to run the server and/or webpack separately, you can also `npm run start-server` and `npm run build-client`.
